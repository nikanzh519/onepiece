        <h1>Mental health</h1>
        <p>One piece has helped with many mental health isues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What life lessons does One Piece teach? - It teaches to stand up for oneself and to take care of your friends. Teaches core values for a good person, empathy for the lesser man, Kindness for others and oneself, that respect isn't one sided, that one doesn't become strong without great effort. Just because there are people in charge doesn't mean that their ways are right. That not all your opposition are truly an enemy.</li>
            <li>How can One Piece help mental strength/How does One Piece promote mental strength? - It shows that mental strength doesn't come as easy for everyone and that everyone has their own way of showing it.To push through to reach their goals no matter what, to say no to the face of adversity. None of the main characters started off being strong, it is their mental fortitude and willingness to adapt and change that made them STRONG. One Piece is just 1 of many anime that show strong values to children, so to push shows like these aside and say "It's just a cartoon" is just wrong. True strength comes in the belief in oneself and One Piece perfectly depicts this

</li>
            <li>Has the One Piece changed the impression of people, Asian and Japanese people included? - In my  opinion yes, the entire world of One Piece is fiction, but every character can be traced to a country , Nami is from Sweden, Luffy is Brazilian, Zoro is Japanese, it helps connect every country in a fantastic story</li>
